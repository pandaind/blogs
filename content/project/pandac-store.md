## 🧭 Overview

A full-stack e-commerce platform demonstrating modern web development: React frontend, Spring Boot backend API, database migrations, Stripe payment processing, JWT authentication, and Nginx reverse proxy.

**Pandac Store** is an educational project built with **React 19**, **Spring Boot 3.5**, **MySQL**, and **Docker**. The application includes product browsing, shopping cart, checkout flow, user authentication, and admin dashboard.

Topics covered:

- 🛍️ **Frontend** → React 19 with Vite, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit
- 🔐 **Authentication** → JWT tokens with role-based access control
- 💳 **Payment Integration** → Stripe Elements and API
- 🎯 **Architecture** → Nginx reverse proxy, centralized API configuration
- 🚀 **Deployment** → Docker Compose with multiple services

------

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Modern React Frontend** → React 19 with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit
- **Robust Spring Boot Backend** → Java 21, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate
- **Stripe Payment Processing** → Secure checkout with Stripe Elements
- **JWT Authentication** → Token-based auth with role-based permissions
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy** → Single entry point, CORS handling, static serving
- **Database Migrations** → Flyway for version-controlled schema changes
- **Admin Dashboard** → Product, order, user, and discount management
- **Responsive Design** → Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

------

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Configure** → Update `.env` with your Stripe API keys
