## 🧭 Overview

A real-time collaborative story estimation tool (Planning Poker) for agile teams. The application demonstrates WebSocket communication, session management, voting systems, and analytics with Spring Boot and React.

**EstiMate** is an educational project built with **Spring Boot 3.2**, **React 18**, and **WebSocket**. The system includes real-time participant updates, multiple estimation methods (Fibonacci, T-Shirt sizes, Powers of 2), story management, voting analytics, and comprehensive testing with Newman (38 API tests) and Playwright (24 E2E tests).

Topics covered:

- 🔌 **WebSocket** → Real-time bidirectional communication
- 🎯 **Session Management** → Code-based session sharing
- 📊 **Data Visualization** → Voting charts and analytics
- ⚡ **React** → Modern UI with Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
- ✅ **Testing** → API tests (Newman) and E2E tests (Playwright)

------

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Flexible Estimation Methods** → Fibonacci, T-Shirt sizes, Powers of 2, Linear, Custom
- **Real-Time Collaboration** → WebSocket for live participant updates and vote synchronization
- **Story Management** → Create, manage, activate, and finalize user stories
- **Voting System** → Vote anonymously, reveal results, track consensus
- **Analytics Dashboard** → Voting distribution charts, consensus indicators, statistics
- **Session Sharing** → 6-character session codes for team collaboration
- **Data Export** → Export session data in JSON/CSV formats
- **Comprehensive Testing** → 38 API tests + 24 E2E tests
