The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is useful when you have a common sequence of steps that are shared among multiple subclasses but may vary in certain details.

### Components of the Template Design Pattern:

1. **Abstract Class (Template)**: Defines the template method that outlines the algorithm's structure and includes some default behavior. It may also include abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
2. **Concrete Class**: Implements the abstract methods defined in the abstract class and may override some steps of the algorithm.

### Simple Example:

Let's say we want to create a system for preparing beverages. The process of preparing a beverage involves several common steps, but the details may vary for different types of beverages.

#### 1. Abstract Class (Template):

```java
// Abstract class defining the template method
abstract class Beverage {
    // Template method
    final void prepareRecipe() {
        boilWater();
        brew();
        pourInCup();
        addCondiments();
    }

    abstract void brew();
    abstract void addCondiments();

    void boilWater() {
        System.out.println("Boiling water");
    }

    void pourInCup() {
        System.out.println("Pouring in cup");
    }
}
```

#### 2. Concrete Classes:

```java
// Concrete class for Tea
class Tea extends Beverage {
    @Override
    void brew() {
        System.out.println("Steeping the tea");
    }

    @Override
    void addCondiments() {
        System.out.println("Adding lemon");
    }
}

// Concrete class for Coffee
class Coffee extends Beverage {
    @Override
    void brew() {
        System.out.println("Dripping coffee through filter");
    }

    @Override
    void addCondiments() {
        System.out.println("Adding sugar and milk");
    }
}
```

#### 3. Client Code:

```java
public class TemplatePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Beverage tea = new Tea();
        Beverage coffee = new Coffee();

        System.out.println("Preparing tea...");
        tea.prepareRecipe();

        System.out.println("\nPreparing coffee...");
        coffee.prepareRecipe();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Abstract Class (Template)**: `Beverage` defines the `prepareRecipe` method, which is a template method outlining the steps to prepare a beverage. It includes some default behavior (e.g., `boilWater`, `pourInCup`) and abstract methods (`brew`, `addCondiments`) that subclasses need to implement.
2. **Concrete Classes**: `Tea` and `Coffee` extend the `Beverage` class and provide specific implementations for the `brew` and `addCondiments` methods.
3. **Client Code**: Demonstrates how to use the template method to prepare different types of beverages using the common algorithm defined in the abstract class.

### Benefits of the Template Design Pattern:

- **Code Reusability**: Common code is defined in the base class, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.
- **Flexibility**: Subclasses can provide specific implementations for certain steps of the algorithm, allowing customization while preserving the overall structure.
- **Control Over Algorithm**: The base class controls the algorithmâ€™s structure, ensuring that all necessary steps are executed in the correct order.

### Use Cases of the Template Design Pattern:

- **Frameworks**: When creating a framework, you can use the template pattern to define a set of steps that the framework will follow, allowing users to customize specific steps.
- **Workflow Systems**: Systems that follow a common workflow but allow for varying details in different scenarios (e.g., data processing pipelines, report generation).
- **Algorithmic Processes**: When implementing algorithms with a fixed structure but varying implementations (e.g., game AI behaviors, data parsing).
