Logging is an essential aspect of any application, providing critical insights and aiding in debugging and monitoring. In a Spring Boot 3 application, you can easily configure log levels for specific loggers to control the verbosity of logs for different packages or classes. In this blog, we'll explore how to achieve this using properties files, YAML configuration, and programmatic approaches.

### Introduction

Spring Boot uses Logback as the default logging framework, but you can also configure other logging frameworks if needed. Here, we'll focus on configuring log levels using the default Logback setup.

### Using `application.properties`

The simplest way to configure log levels in a Spring Boot application is by setting properties in the `application.properties` file. You can specify log levels for specific packages or classes as follows:

```properties
logging.level.com.yourpackage=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.web=INFO
logging.level.com.yourpackage.YourClass=TRACE
```

### Using `application.yml`

If you prefer YAML for configuration, you can achieve the same result by adding entries to the `application.yml` file:

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    com:
      yourpackage: DEBUG
      yourpackage.YourClass: TRACE
    org:
      springframework:
        web: INFO
```

### Programmatic Configuration

You can also configure log levels programmatically within your Spring Boot application. This approach is useful if you need to adjust log levels dynamically based on certain conditions.

```java
import org.springframework.boot.logging.LogLevel;
import org.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;

@Component
public class LogLevelConfigurer {

    private final LoggingSystem loggingSystem;

    public LogLevelConfigurer(LoggingSystem loggingSystem) {
        this.loggingSystem = loggingSystem;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void configureLogLevels() {
        loggingSystem.setLogLevel("com.yourpackage", LogLevel.DEBUG);
        loggingSystem.setLogLevel("org.springframework.web", LogLevel.INFO);
        loggingSystem.setLogLevel("com.yourpackage.YourClass", LogLevel.TRACE);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `LoggingSystem` is injected into the `LogLevelConfigurer` class, and log levels are set in the `configureLogLevels` method, which is annotated with `@PostConstruct` to ensure it runs after the bean is created.

### Customizing Logback Configuration

Spring Boot uses Logback by default, and you can customize its configuration by creating a `logback-spring.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory. This file allows for advanced logging configurations.

Hereâ€™s an example `logback-spring.xml` configuration:

```xml
<configuration>

    <property name="LOG_PATTERN" value="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n"/>

    <appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>${LOG_PATTERN}</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/>
    </root>

    <logger name="com.yourpackage" level="DEBUG"/>
    <logger name="org.springframework.web" level="INFO"/>
    <logger name="com.yourpackage.YourClass" level="TRACE"/>

</configuration>
```

This configuration sets the log levels for different packages and classes and uses a custom log pattern for console output.

### Conclusion

Configuring log levels for specific loggers in a Spring Boot 3 application is straightforward and can be done using properties files, YAML configuration, or programmatically. Additionally, you can customize the default Logback configuration to suit your needs. By fine-tuning log levels, you can control the verbosity of logs, making it easier to monitor and debug your application.
