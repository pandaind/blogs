**Introduction:**

In software development, reusing configurations is a smart way to keep your code clean and modular. If you're working with Spring Boot 3, there are some handy annotations you can use to import existing configurations into your project. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use `@Import` and `@ImportResource` to achieve this.

**Importing Java Configurations with @Import:**

The `@Import` annotation is used to bring in configurations from other Java classes. This is especially useful when you have common configurations that you want to reuse across multiple applications.

**Example Scenario:**
Imagine you have two configuration classes, `AppConfig1` and `AppConfig2`, that you want to reuse in your main configuration class. Here's how you can do it:

```java
@Configuration
@Import({ AppConfig1.class, AppConfig2.class })
public class MainConfig {
    // Your configuration code here
}
```

With this setup, `MainConfig` now includes all the configurations defined in `AppConfig1` and `AppConfig2`. This makes it easy to manage and reuse your configurations without duplicating code.

**Importing XML Configurations with @ImportResource:**

If you have existing XML configuration files, you can use the `@ImportResource` annotation to bring them into your Spring Boot application. This is a great way to integrate legacy XML configurations with your new Spring Boot projects.

**Example:**
Let's say you have an XML configuration file named `applicationContext.xml`. You can import it into your Spring Boot application like this:

```java
@Configuration
@ImportResource("classpath:applicationContext.xml")
public class MainConfig {
    // Your configuration code here
}
```

By doing this, all the beans and settings defined in `applicationContext.xml` are now part of your Spring Boot application.

**Combining @Import and @ImportResource:**

In some cases, you might need to import both Java and XML configurations. Luckily, Spring Boot allows you to combine `@Import` and `@ImportResource` annotations.

**Example:**
Hereâ€™s how you can import both types of configurations into a single class:

```java
@Configuration
@Import({ AppConfig1.class, AppConfig2.class })
@ImportResource("classpath:applicationContext.xml")
public class MainConfig {
    // Your configuration code here
}
```

With this combination, `MainConfig` includes configurations from both Java classes and the XML file, giving you a flexible and powerful way to manage your application's setup.

**Conclusion:**

Reusing configurations in Spring Boot 3 is a great way to keep your codebase clean and maintainable. By using `@Import` and `@ImportResource`, you can easily bring in existing configurations, whether they are in Java classes or XML files. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across your applications.
